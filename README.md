Core Radio Client
Core Radio Client is a Python-based project that dynamically scrapes song metadata and album art from a radio stream and serves it via a lightweight web page. It automatically updates song information and album art in real-time.

Features
Dynamic Album Art: Scrapes album art from a web page and dynamically updates based on the most recent file.
Song Metadata: Fetches band and track info from current_track.txt.
Web Server: Serves a simple web page showing the current song and band with the latest album art.
Real-time Updates: Automatically detects updates to the current_track.txt file and updates the web page.
Project Structure
albumart.py: Scrapes album art from a webpage, downloads it, and monitors current_track.txt for changes.
metadata.py: Handles fetching song metadata (band and track) from current_track.txt.
app.js: Fetches song data and dynamically updates the album art (supports .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).
index.html: Displays the current song, band, and album art in a web page.
run_client.py: Runs both albumart.py and metadata.py concurrently while serving the web app via a local HTTP server.
styles.css: Styles the web page layout and visual design.

Ensure ChromeDriver is Installed:

Download and install ChromeDriver from here.
Make sure it's accessible via your system's PATH.
Run the Application: Use the run_client.py script to start both album art scraping and metadata fetching, and to serve the web app:

bash
Copy code
python run_client.py
Access the Web Page:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the current song, band, and album art.
Customization
Album Art Format:

The script supports multiple album art formats (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).
Ensure that art.* files are updated in your project directory, and the script will automatically choose the most recent one.
Web Server Port:

The default port for the local web server is 8080. You can change this by modifying the PORT variable in run_client.py.
Troubleshooting
Error: Selenium ChromeDriver not found:

Ensure that ChromeDriver is installed and correctly set in your systemâ€™s PATH.
Album Art Not Updating:

Verify that the correct file extensions are being used for the album art (.jpg, .png, etc.).
Ensure the current_track.txt file is being updated as expected.
